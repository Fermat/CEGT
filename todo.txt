-- 1. Implement reduction tree? And display path? It can be very large and you better 
do it good. [done.]

-- 2. Generating evidence for loops[done, but need to refine the loop pattern.].

-- 3. Device hereustic method for some non-loop/regular word of order 2. 

--3. Implement a very simple version of second order matching, and go for a more interactive style
in order to handle the examples in the paper.

------------
1. Refine the local enviroment
2. backtrack some steps? 
3. Add finished proof as lemma to the environment
